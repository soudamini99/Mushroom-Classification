# Mushroom-Classification
Mushrooms , a special kind of food are very special due to their edibility.Some countries treat mushrooms as a kind of high nutrition food. However, only small portions of them are edible. It is really dangerous to eat a poisonous mushroom. Thus, I used some classification algorithms to develop a best model to predict whether new emerging mushrooms are edible based on the detected data of the mushrooms. Multi nominal Naive Bayes Classifier ,Support Vector Machines with a linear kernel, K-means Clustering and Decision Tree Classifiers are implemented on the data set. The data is best classified by the Support Vector Machines with optimum accuracy.
